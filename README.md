### Backend (Server)

- `server/index.ts`: Sets up the Express server, middleware, error handling
- `server/routes.ts`: Defines API routes for:
  - Push notification subscription management (`/api/subscribe`, `/api/unsubscribe`)

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Firebase API key
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Firebase project ID
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`: Firebase app ID

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Deployment

The application can be deployed directly using Replit Deployments, which handles:
- SSL certificates and HTTPS
- Database migration
- Environment variable configuration
- Custom domain support (optional)

After deployment, make sure to:
1. Add your production URL to Firebase authorized domains
2. Test all features in the production environment

## Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" button
2. Firebase Auth opens Google sign-in popup
3. After successful sign-in, the user state is updated in AuthContext
4. User-specific settings are loaded from localStorage or default settings
5. Settings are synchronized across devices for the same user

## Push Notification Architecture

1. Service worker registers with browser
2. Subscription is sent to backend and stored in database
3. When a market opens, notification is sent to all subscribed devices
4. Service worker displays notification even when browser is closed

## Known Limitations

- Push notifications require HTTPS and won't work in development mode without proper SSL
- Some browsers limit background notifications to conserve battery
- Mobile Safari has limited Web Push API support
